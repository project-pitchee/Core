/*
 * The caller MUST supply 16 kHz mono Float32 PCM; no sample-rate/channel
 * conversion is performed, and all lag and window sizes assume this format.
 * HNR consumes 16 kHz mono Float32 PCM and precomputed VAD intervals; it does
 * not run a VAD or load models. Windows are 40 ms with a 10 ms hop. A window's
 * actual (clipped) midpoint must be in a VAD interval [start, end) before any
 * PCM is examined. An empty interval list therefore yields only nil windows.
 * Intervals must be finite, nonnegative, sorted, nonoverlapping, with start <
 * end. Intervals may extend past the input duration; only input windows are
 * queried. Adjacent intervals are allowed. NULL is valid only for count == 0.
 * No heap allocation or locks. out_summary is required; callback may be NULL.
 * Empty PCM succeeds with no windows and has_hnr == 0.
 * All callbacks run synchronously on the calling thread before return.
 * No PCM/VAD/callback/user_data pointer is retained. A window pointer is valid
 * only during its callback; copy any values needed afterward.
